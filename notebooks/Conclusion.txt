1. SMOTEENN
    -> -1 Class:
        * F1-Score: 0.849 (Best among all methods)
        * Precision: 0.883 (Best among all methods)
        * Recall: 0.819 (Best among all methods)
        * Summary: SMOTEENN handles class -1 exceptionally well, leading in all three metrics. 
    
    -> 0 Class:
        * F1-Score: 0.806 (Strongly, only slightly behind class weight)
        * Precision: 0.726
        * Recall: 0.905 (Best among all methods)
        * Summary: Strong Performance on class 0, particularly in recall, although precision could be improved. 

    -> 1 Class:
        * F1-Score: 0.08 (Extremely low)
        * Precision: 1.00 (Perfect Precision but very low recall)
        * Recall: 0.905 (Extremely poor recall, leading to very low F1)
        * Summary: Thsi methods fails to handle class 1 effectively. The perfect precision is misleading since it misses a large portion of class1 instances, as indicated by its recall.

        -> Accuracy: 0.799 (Best among all methods).
        -> Macro Avg (F1-Score): 0.578
        -> Macro Avg (Precision): 0.87 (Best precision overall)
        -> Macro Avg (Recall): 0.589
        -> Weighted Avg (F1-score): 0.775 (Best Weighted F1)

Conclusion: SMOTEENN is excellent for class -1 and class 0, but fails at class 1. It has the best overall precision but lacks balance due to poor class 1 recall. 

2. Undersampling:
    -> -1 class:
        - F1-score: 0.595
        - Precision: 0.732
        - Recall: 0.501
        - Summary: Undersampling is weak on class -1. While precision is decent, recall is low, leading to a lower F1-score. 

    -> 0 class:
        - F1-score: 0.729
        - Precision: 0.599 (Lowest among all methods)
        - Recall: 0.93 (Best recall among all methods)
